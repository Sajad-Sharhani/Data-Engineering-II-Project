# Data-Engineering-II-Project

## Project Description

is an exciting endeavor undertaken as part of the Data Engineering II course at Uppsala University. The objective is to develop an efficient analytic system for GitHub, leveraging the capabilities of Apache Pulsar, a streaming framework, and Kubernetes, a container orchestration platform.

The system aims to address the limitations of GitHub's existing search capabilities by streaming data from GitHub's API and employing Apache Pulsar for real-time analysis. By utilizing these cutting-edge technologies, developers will gain access to invaluable insights that were previously unavailable.

The analytic system will focus on answering key questions such as identifying popular programming languages, highlighting vulnerabilities in popular projects, monitoring active projects, and tracking community trends. Through the power of Apache Pulsar's streaming capabilities and the scalability provided by Kubernetes, the system will efficiently process the continuous flow of data, ensuring up-to-date insights.

Within the project, significant emphasis will be placed on implementing robust data streaming mechanisms using Apache Pulsar and seamlessly deploying and scaling the system using Kubernetes. The end result will be a user-friendly interface or API, enabling developers to effortlessly access and leverage the wealth of information available within the GitHub data stream.

This project serves as a valuable hands-on learning experience as part of the Data Engineering II course at Uppsala University. It combines cutting-edge technologies, real-world data analysis challenges, and the opportunity to contribute to the GitHub developer community. By developing this GitHub analytic system, the project aims to equip participants with practical data engineering skills and enhance their understanding of streaming frameworks and container orchestration platforms.
